# Django Learning Project

## Introduction
This repository contains a Django project that I am building as part of my learning journey.  
The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Django by implementing core concepts and gradually adding features.

This project focuses on understanding **how Django works internally**, rather than building a production-ready application.

---

## Learning Goals
Through this project, I aim to:
- Understand Django project and app structure
- Learn Django’s MVT (Model–View–Template) architecture
- Work with URLs, views, and templates
- Use Django ORM for database operations
- Perform migrations and manage models
- Explore Django Admin and basic authentication
- Debug common Django errors

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Django  
- **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS  
- **Database:** SQLite (default Django database)  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git, Virtual Environment
